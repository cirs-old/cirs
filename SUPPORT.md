Support Guidelines
===

Thank you for using Cirs. When trying getting support regarding the Cirs
project, please consider the following:

# Communication
Our primary discussion and support channel is Discord, which you can join with
this [invite](https://discord.gg/rN9urdQ).

# Reporting an Issue, Requesting a Feature

When submitting an issue through GitHub Issues, please remember that we are
volunteers, and as volunteers, we only can spend our free time towards
development and support of `cirs`. To that end, please keep the following in
mind when reporting bugs and requesting features:

* Make the title of the report clear. "It's broken" does not help us much,
"function <x> has regression" is more helpful and lets us see what is wrong
just by looking at the list.

* When reporting a bug:
    * Describe how you reproduce the bug step by step
    * Explain what you expect to happen
    * Explain what actually happens
    * Include backtraces (using RUST_BACKTRACE=1), when necessary.

* When describing a feature:
    * Tell us what you'd like to see
    * Tell us why you want it, and what the use case is
    * Give us an idea on how it should work

* If we need more information about a bug or a feature, we'll ask for
clarification! We want to get the system right.
